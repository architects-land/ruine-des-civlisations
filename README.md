## Modifications

The modpack uses a modified version of *Larion's World Generation*: it allows caves in the surface.

We wanted to add the main *Dungeons and Taverns* mod, but custom enchantments is definitly not 
vanilla friendly.

This modpack is licensed under the MIT license, but every jar file may not follow this license.
