## Modifications

The modpack uses a modified version of *Larion's World Generation*: it allows caves in the surface.

We wanted to add the main *Dungeons and Taverns* mod, but custom enchantments are definitely not 
vanilla friendly.

A jar file of *Distant Horizons*'s preview version is present and will be replaced by their Modrinth 
release as soon as they release the beta.

This modpack is licensed under the MIT license, but every jar file may not follow this license.
