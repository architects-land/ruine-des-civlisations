# Ruine des Civilisations

Ruine des Civilisations is a season of Architects Land.
Its specificity is the huge modification of the generation and the difficulty mod.

## Modifications

The modpack uses a modified version of *Larion's World Generation*: it allows caves in the surface.

The modpack also uses a modified version of *Dungeons and Taverns*: we removed custom enchantments
because it is definitely not vanilla friendly. (Thanks [SuperNoobYT](https://github.com/SuperNoobYT).)

This modpack is licensed under the MIT license, but every jar file may not follow this license.
